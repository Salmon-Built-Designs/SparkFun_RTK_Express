  Download the entire configuration of a module

  License: MIT. See license file for more information but you can
  basically do whatever you want with this code.

  This example shows how to download the entire ZED configuration and display
  it over serial. This same data can be piped to an SD card or other text file
  that can later be opened by u-center or by the uploadDeviceConfig() function.

  Feel like supporting open source hardware?
  Buy a board from SparkFun!
  ZED-F9P RTK2: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15136
  NEO-M8P RTK: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15005

  Hardware Connections:
  Plug a Qwiic cable into the GNSS and a BlackBoard
  If you don't have a platform with a Qwiic connection use the SparkFun Qwiic Breadboard Jumper (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14425)
  Open the serial monitor at 115200 baud to see the output
